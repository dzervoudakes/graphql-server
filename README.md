# GraphQL Server

> Mini GraphQL server for querying and mutating a small database of vehicles.

## Motivation

Historically I'm more familiar with consuming GraphQL APIs on the frontend (Apollo Client is awesome, by the way). I haven't yet created my own GraphQL server from scratch and so I thought it would be a fun learning experience. I've worked within a Graphene model in a Python/Flask app before, though I was curious to explore an Express-centric solution as well.

Shout out to [mockaroo](https://mockaroo.com/) for making generation of mock data painless. ðŸ¦˜

## Project Setup

- Ensure that `Docker` is installed and running
- In a terminal window at the project root, run `yarn install`
- Run `docker compose up` to seed the database and start the Express server

While the server is running, the GraphiQL playground can be accessed in a web browser at `http://localhost:3000/graphql`.

## Example Queries

### Get All Cars

```gql
{
  getAllCars {
    id
    make
    model
    year
    vin
  }
}
```

### Get Car by ID

```gql
{
  getCarById(id: "60e27002aed956ce6772d774") {
    id
    make
    model
    year
    vin
  }
}
```

### Get Cars by Make and Model

```gql
{
  getCarsByMakeAndModel(make: "Acura", model: "TL") {
    id
    make
    model
    year
    vin
  }
}
```

## Example Mutations

### Create Car

```gql
mutation {
  createCar(make: "Acura", model: "TL", year: 1998, vin: "1D4PT5GK8BW557445") {
    id
    make
    model
    year
    vin
  }
}
```

### Update Car

```gql
mutation {
  updateCar(id: "60e27002aed956ce6772d774", make: "Acura", model: "TSX", year: 1998, vin: "1D4PT5GK8BW557445") {
    id
    make
    model
    year
    vin
  }
}
```

### Delete Car

```gql
mutation {
  deleteCar(id: "60e27002aed956ce6772d774") {
    id
    make
    model
    year
    vin
  }
}
```
